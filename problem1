The site's internet connectivity issues could be due to a DNS configuration issue from the symptoms that were given.  I logged into the client workstation and immediately checked the network configuration files. The configuration looked correct and I was able to ping the gateway "10.0.0.1". The "dig" and "nslookup" commands revealed that the primary DNS server was not resolving IP addresses because it wasn't configured to forward requests. I logged into both DNS servers and could not find any DNS configuration files. I tried installing BIND on the 10.0.0.9 server, configuring the files, and running the service but it failed. I ended up just shuttting down the server so that the secondary server would respond to DNS requests. Although web pages are now available to the site, this is only a temporary solution to the configuration issue on 10.0.0.9.
